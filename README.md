# UnityRelpWindow

REX allows expression evaluation at runtime to facilitate testing and debugging.

Game programming is a notoriously complex and error prone process. The ability to inspect variables and execute functions at run time is powerful for developers and helps mitigate some of that complexity.

Testing various aspects of a game at runtime has proven difficult, e.g. having to wait until a certain point has been reached to see if a certain event occurred correctly. REX is an excellent tool to counter this problem.

## Features
- Runtime evaluation of C# expressions
- Dynamic declaration of variables
- Intelligent code completion
- Lambda expression support
- Detailed output of expressions
- Macro frequently used expressions
