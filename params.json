The ability to inspect variables and execute functions at run time is powerful for developers and helps mitigate some of that complexity.\r\n\r\nTesting various aspects of a game at runtime has proven difficult, e.g. having to wait until a certain point has been reached to see if a certain event occurred correctly. REX is an excellent tool to counter this problem.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Runtime evaluation of C# expressions\r\n- Dynamic declaration of variables\r\n- Intelligent code completion\r\n- Lambda expression support\r\n- Detailed output of expressions\r\n- Macro frequently used expressions\r\n- No T-REX included\r\n\r\n \r\n## Quick reference\r\n \r\n#### Handles any expression\r\n![Handles any expression](https://github.com/thorgeirk11/UnityRelpWindow/blob/master/Screenshots/GreenCube.gif)\r\n\r\nThe ability to create variables at runtime is an easy process in REX.\r\n\r\n#### Linq and anonymous function support\r\n![Screen shot](https://github.com/thorgeirk11/UnityRelpWindow/blob/master/Screenshots/Linq.gif)\r\n\r\nManipulating variables, complex linq statements, lambda expressions or just simple expressions. All are possible with REX\r\n\r\n#### Useful error messages\r\n![Screen shot](https://github.com/thorgeirk11/UnityRelpWindow/blob/master/Screenshots/ErrorMessage.gif)\r\n\r\nIntelligent code completion makes writing expressions much easier. REX also helps you get to the root of a problem with graceful error handling.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The UI Layout\r\n![Screen shot](https://github.com/thorgeirk11/UnityRelpWindow/blob/master/Screenshots/REX_instruction_pic.png)\r\n\r\n1. **Expression** - The primary input where you write expressions\r\n2. **Scope** - Determine which namespaces the expressions will have access to\r\n3. **History** - Keep all evaluated expressions\r\n4. **Variables** - List of declared variables\r\n5. **Macros** - Save frequently used expressions between sessions\r\n6. **Output** - Detailed expression results\r\n\r\n",
